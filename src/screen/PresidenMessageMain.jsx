            <h1>Dear Friends!</h1>
            <h1>
              My sincere gratitude for giving me this stage, this podium, this
              mike, this opportunity, and this medallion which has fingerprints
              of wisdom of 74 unparalleled stalwarts. It’s an honour, great
              honour to enter in platinum year of a great journey.
            </h1>

              IPS was born officially in December 1948, and this is 75th year
              which will lead us to 75th ANCIPS being held at Kochi. It’s a
              matter of great fortune that I have been installed as 75th
              President in this glittering platinum year.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              I attended first ANCIPS in year 1992 and since then never missed
              any ANCIPS, nor any AGBM. In 32 years, I have seen ANCPS growing
              from 400 to 4000 delegates. Currently we have 8300 members, and I
              am sure we will cross 10K mark in this year.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              Dear friends, strength matters so please motivate new
              psychiatrists to join IPS. We are an academic organisation, and we
              must identify the challenges in this area. One of the biggest
              challenges remains adding significance to UG psychiatry and
              homogenisation of PG psychiatry education. We thank the National
              Medical Commission for introducing CBME for UG and PG education,
              but its implementation is a tough task. IPS has responded to by
              instituting Teachers training task force which is very active.
              This year we plan to have a Psychiatry Teachers Forum which will
              be a large and interactive group updating one and all. Our long
              pending demand of giving importance to psychiatry in MBBS clinical
              examination is still unfulfilled and we will keep our advocacy
              group active. We must acknowledge that a large chunk of our
              members are in private practice and we need to take care of their
              educational and other needs as well. We are almost ready with a
              dedicated web portal though which attempts will be made to address
              their needs.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              Our concerns related to MHCA has not been addressed. Our plea in
              Honourable High Court of Mumbai is facing “Tareekh after Tareekh”.
              There is need to form a strong advocacy group to talk to
              Government for some amendments to make MHCA an Indian one.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              Our journal is reaching milestone after milestone. Now it has
              become monthly to accommodate more research works. Our research
              foundation, which has made history by developing a model of low
              cost research, under the leadership of our past president Prof
              Ajit Avasthi, is gearing up for 5 multi centric studies every
              year. Also, we are thinking of international collaborations
              because in this global village many concerns are common. We are
              thinking of is forming an Academy of Education and Research which
              will be a constitution body like election commission. The academy
              will be a bigger umbrella under which our education research
              activities will flourish.

              One fine morning while I was walking, lost in my inner forest, I
              suddenly saw a huge, big and beautiful building in Delhi NCR. The
              name of the building was Prashanti Bhawan. When I entered in this
              building, I was surprised to see a very meaningful mental health
              museum on two floors. Took a lift and met another surprise – there
              was an Academy of Education and research with a well-functioning
              library. On another floor there was Institute of Public Mental
              Health which was engaged in training laypersons and caregivers for
              capacity building and providing tele psychiatric help to needy
              people in 14 languages. And on the top, there was a big meeting
              room. I know this dream is too ambitious for small duration of one
              year, but IPS is not for one year and I am sure this dream will be
              realised soon. Meanwhile, we can think of Virtual Museum, virtual
              library, virtual mental health art gallery, and an online archive
              of films related to mental health.

            <h1>
              We observe IPS foundation day on 7th of January and fix a theme
              usually one or two months earlier. This year we are setting a new
              tradition by announcing the theme not only for the Foundation Day
              program but also for the year, and the Theme is – Happy Family
              Healthy Mind! Let us organise multiple family centric programs at
              local state zonal and national levels online and offline. We may
              focus on Mental health promotion, patients and caregivers’
              education and psychosocial rehabilitation.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              With these few words, I request all the members to extend their
              support in realising some platinum dreams.
